## What the does SuBo0 do? 
SuBo0 is a simple survey bot to do a technical pretest for survey programmed with ingress. 
SuBo stands for Survey Bot. A 0 is added to show that this version is a first proof of concept. After beta testing, we intend to further develop SuBo0. 

## Why is SuBo0 useful?
SuBo0 can be used to conduct a technical pretest for your online survey. That is, SuBo0 responses to your survey several times to generate data. You can use this data to take a look how your survey data will look like after conducting the survey. Based on the technical pretest, you may want to check your filter setting and naming of the variables. If you don't do any changes, you may even start data editing while your survey is still conducted. As a result, you may are faster in publishing your insights. 

## Limitations 
The app contains some bugs and limitations. We will try to fix these in future version. For now keep the following limitations in mind when using the app:
- SuBo0 only works for online surveys programmed in Ingress (see https://www.ingress.de/Software/Umfragesoftware-keyingress/)
- Only a limited number of response options are implemented:
    - Single responses
    - Multiple responses
    - Rating scales 
    - Dombination of single responses and textfield
    - Dropdown menus
    - Textfield responses for numbers
    - Textarea responses 
- Bug: If the app is used by multiple user, the screenshots get scrampled and screenshots from both users will be shown. However, I would recommend to not watch SuBo0 while responding as it takes longer. Only use this function for a test run.
